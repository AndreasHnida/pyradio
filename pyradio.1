.SH CONFIG FILE
\fBpyradio\fR upon its execution tries to read its configuration file (i.e. \fI~/.config/pyradio/config\fR). If this file is not found, it will be created. If an error occurs while parsing it, an error message will be displayed and \fBpyradio\fR will terminate.

The file contains parameters such as the player to use, the playlist to load etc. It is heavily commented, so that manual editing is really easy. The best practice to manually edit this file is executing \fBpyradio\fR with the \fB-ocd\fR command line option, which will open the configuration directory in your file manager, and then edit it using your preferable text editor.

The file can also be altered while \fBpyradio\fR is running. This process is transparent to the user; \fBpyradio\fR will save the file before exiting (or in case Ctrl-C is pressed) if needed (e.g. if a config parameter has been changed during its execution).

.SH ABOUT PLAYLIST FILES
.PP
\fBpyradio\fR reads the stations to use from a CSV file, where each line contains two columns, the first being the station name and the second being the stream URL.
.PP
\fBpyradio\fR will by default load the user's stations file (e.g. \fI~/.config/pyradio/stations.csv\fR). If this file is not found, it will be created and populated with a default set of stations.

.IP \fBTip:
If you already have a custom \fIstations.csv\fR file, but want to update it with \fBpyradio\fR's default one, you just rename it, run \fBpyradio\fR (so that the default one get created) and then merge the two files.

.IP \fBNote:
Older versions used to use \fI~/.pyradio\fR as default stations file. If this file is found, it will be copied to use's config directory (e.g. \fI~/.config/pyradio\fR) and renamed to \fIstations.csv\fR or if this file exists, to \fIpyradio.csv\fR. In this case, this file will be the default one.

.PP
.B
Specifying a playlist to load (command line)

.PP
\fBpyradio\fR will normally load its default playlist file, as described above, upon its execution. A different file can be loaded when the \fI-s\fR command line option is used.

.PP
The \fI-s\fR option will accept:

.HP

\fI*\fR a relative or absolute file name.

\fI*\fR the name of a playlist file which is already in its configuration directory.

\fI*\fR the number of a playlist file, as provided by the \fI-ls\fR command line option.

.PP
\fBExamples:\fR

.HP
To load a playlist called "\fIblues.csv\fR", one would use the command:

.RS 5
\fBpyradio -s /path/to/\fIblues.csv\fR

.RE
If this file was saved inside \fBpyradio\fR's configuration directory, one could use the following command:

.RS 5
\fBpyradio -s \fIblues\fR

.RE
To use the playlist number, one would execute the commands:

.RS 5

\fBpyradio -ls\fI

Playlists found in "/home/user/.config/pyradio"
  1. hip-hop
  2. party
  3. stations
  4. huge
  \fB5. blues\fI
  6. rock
  7. pop

\fBpyradio -s \fI5\fR


.IP \fBNote\fR
The default playlist to load can also be set in \fBpyradio\fR’s configuration file, parameter \fIdefault_playlist\fR (default value is \fIstations\fR).

.RE
.PP
.B
MANAGING PLAYLISTS (WITHIN PYRADIO)

Once \fBpyradio\fR has been loaded, one can perform a series of actions on the current playlist and set of playlists saved in its configuration directory.

Currently, the following actions are available:

One thing you may want to do is remove a station from a playlist, e.g. when found that it not longer works. You can do that by pressing "\fIDEL\fR" or "\fIx\fR".

Then, when this is done, you can either save the modified playlist, by pressing "\fIs\fR", or reload the playlist from disk, by pressing "\fIR\fR". A modified playlist will \fIautomatically\fR be saved when \fBpyradio\fR exits (or Ctrl-C is pressed).

Finally, opening another playlist is also possible. Just press "\fIo\fR" and you will be presented with a list of saved playists to choose from. These playlists must be saved beforehand in \fBpyradio\fR's configuration directory.

While executing any of the previous actions, you may get confirmation messages (when opening a playlist while the current one is modified but not saved, for example) or error messages (when an action fails). Just follow the on screen information, keeping in mind that a capital letter as an answer will save this answer in **PyRadio**'s configuration file for future reference.

.PP
.B
MANAGING “FOREIGN” PLAYLISTS

A playlist that does not reside within the program’s configuration directory is considered a "\fIforeign\fR" playlist. This playlist can only be opened by the \fB-s\fR command line option.

When this happens, \fBpyradio\fR will offer you the choise to copy the playlist in its configuration directory, thus making it available for manipulation within the program.

If a playlist of the same name already exists in the configuration directory, the "\fIforeign\fR" playlist will be time-stamped. For example, if a "\fIforeign\fR" playlist is named "\fIstations.csv\fR", it will be named "\fI2019-01-11_13:35:47_stations.csv\fR" (provided that the action was taked on January 11, 2019 at 13:35:47).

.SH PLAYER DETECTION / SELECTION
.PP
\fBpyradio\fR is basically built around the existence of a valid media player it can use. Thus, it will auto detect the existence of its supported players upon its execution.
.PP
Currently, it supports \fIMPV\fR, \fIMPlayer\fR and \fIVLC\fR, and it will look for them in that order. If none of them is found, the program will terminate with an error.
.PP
MPV will be used only when the \fIsocat\fR multipurpose relay is also installed.
.PP
Users can alter this default behavior by using the \fB-u\fR command line option. This option will permit the user either to specify the player to use, or change the detection order.
.PP
Example:

.IP \fBpyradio\ -u\ vlc
will instruct \fBpyradio\fR to use VLC; if it is not found, the program will terminate with an error.

.IP \fBpyradio\ -u\ vlc,mplayer,mpv
will instruct \fBpyradio\fR to look for VLC, then MPlayer and finaly for MPV and use whichever it finds first; if none is found, the program will terminate with an error.


.IP \fBNote\fR
The default player to use can also be set in \fBpyradio\fR’s configuration file, parameter \fIplayer\fR (default value is \fImpv, mplayer, vlc\fR).

.SH PLAYER DEFAULT VOLUME LEVEL
.PP
\fIMPV\fR and \fIMPlayer\fR, when started, use their saved (or default) volume level to play any multimedia content. Fortunately, this is not the case with \fIVLC\fR.
.PP
This introduces a problem to \fBpyradio\fR: every time a user plays a station (i.e restarts playback), even though he may have already set the volume to a desired level, the playback starts at the player's default level.
.PP
The way to come around it, is to save the desired volume level in a way that it will be used by the player whenever it is restarted.
.PP
This is done by typing "\fIv\fR" right after setting a desired volume level.
.PP
\fBMPV\fR
.PP
\fIMPV\fR uses profiles to customize its behavior.
.PP
\fBpyradio\fR defines a profile called "\fI[pyradio]\fR" in MPV's configuration file (e.g. \fI~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf\fR). This profile will be used every time playback is started.
.PP
Example:

.HP

\fIvolume=100

[pyradio]
.br
volume=50

.PP
\fBMPlayer\fR
.PP
\fIMPlayer\fR uses profiles to customize its behavior as well.
.PP
\fBpyradio\fR defines a profile called "\fI[pyradio]\fR" in MPV's configuration file (e.g. \fI~/.mplayer/config\fR). This profile will be used every time playback is started.
.PP
Example:

.HP

\fIvolume=100

[pyradio]
.br
volstep=1
.br
volume=28

.SH DEBUG MODE
.PP
Adding the \fB-d\fR option to the command line will instruct \fBpyradio\fR to enter \fBDebug mode\fR, which means that it will print debug messages to a file. This file will always reside in the user's home directory and will be named \fIpyradio.log\fR.

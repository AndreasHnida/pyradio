    * Trying to minimize the possibility of curses layout breakage
    * Start of playback detection implemented. This is done by
      detecting the players audio decoder info, which actually mean
      that playback is on. If not detected within a timeout value,
      failure to connect is presumed
    * Volume adjustment, saving and muting inhibited before start
      of playback is detected
    * Adding search function for both player and playlist mode
    * Stations name is limited to window width
	* Station title is validated before displayed

    * Version 0.7.0
    * added command line options -ls, -scd, -ocd
    * make sure config dir exists before doing anything with it
    * make sure the playlist is valid (-s option)
    * Option -s accepts playlist name only, if it exists in config dir, or
      playlist number as reported by the -ls command line option
    * -a command line option works in combination with -s
    * -l command line option prints a tabular list
    * started implementing playlist management. Now we can open another
      playlist, remove a station from a playlist and save a playlist.
      TODO: rename playlist, copy playlist, add station, edit station
    * added configuration file (~/.config/pyradio/config)
      TODO: edit configuration file within PyRadio
    * Input encoding can now de set either in a station by
      station mode or globally
    * ESCAPE now works for exit/cancel
    * ESCDELAY set to 25ms. Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27372068/why-does-the-escape-key-have-a-delay-in-python-curses for more info
    * "Foreign" playlist handing added. A playlist that does not reside in
      PyRadio's config dir (called a "foreign playlist") can now be copyied
      there, making it available for opening from within PyRadio.
    * '/' win no longer display help ('?' is still valid)
    * minor errors fixed
    * error_code renamed to operation_mode
    * build script working on MacOS
